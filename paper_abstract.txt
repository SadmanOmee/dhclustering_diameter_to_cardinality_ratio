We consider the problem of "dissection effect" here. The problem is caused when points naturally belonging to the same cluster are assigned to separate clusters. As we want data clusters to be compact, it sometimes results in unnecessary splitting of a natural cluster. For k number of clusters and n data points, we present an O(nklogn) algorithm for reducing this problem. Our algorithm is a divisive hierarchical type clustering algorithm. Our algorithm not only takes account about the compactness of the clusters but also the mutual distance of clusters as well. We test our algoithm with different data sets. We compare our result to commonly known clustering algorithms developed for this purpose and also with the very well known k-Means algorithm.
